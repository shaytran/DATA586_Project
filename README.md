## Introduction
The integration of deep learning, particularly through Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNNs) like the Faster R-CNN, has revolutionized medical imaging by enabling precise localization and classification of blood cells. This method overcomes traditional limitations by utilizing a region proposal network (RPN) that enhances the speed and accuracy of the model, crucial for effective diagnostics in hematological settings. By adapting and evaluating a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model on the BCCD dataset[^1], this study explores and demonstrates the efficacy and accuracy of our implemented R-CNN model on blood classification.
